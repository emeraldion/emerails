About EmeRails
==============

In the middle of February 2008, I became unsatisfied with the current homebrew framework I was using for the Emeraldion Lodge, EmePavilion. I felt the need for a solid platform that was object-oriented, fully MVC compliant, and had an ORM layer that relieved me from having to hardcode repetitive query patterns.

I then tried to write from scratch a lightweight clone of [Ruby on Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org/), by replicating much of their ActiveRecord model class, and a convention-based development model. I struggled against the syntactical and practical limitations of the language I am bound to with my hosting, [PHP](http://www.php.net/), but at the end I had a working framework in less than a month.

EmeRails supports page caching, action filtering and a lot of useful features that save coding time and server load. I am quite satisfied about the result, and I am looking forward to improving it and smudging the edges that are still rough in the future.
